This Latest Version of the Software is Version 1.0

Pls don’t sue ;_;

So I created this program basically because I’m a huge fan of what dan salvato has made with Doki Doki Literature Club and wanted to create something of my own. :3

With this program, I took the script from the ending of the game and made it it’s own standalone program. 
I will be adding features to the program as time goes on and I will be uploading them to my GitHub (https://github.com/JakeStarGames) as different versions. 
You can also actually contribute yourself by filling out this google survey for bug fixes, suggestions to the program, helping out with the program (?), etc. (https://goo.gl/forms/EyNbtlVUQmoEng2M2). 
I would greatly appreciate if you filled it out so I can get feedback and make the program even better! Then again, I’m happy that you even wanted to download and try my program out in the first place so thank you for that too! 
If you’re wondering what I used to make this program, I programmed it entirely in python. I included the source code on my GitHub also in case you wanna see the inner workings of the program (I like to do that too, don’t worry). 
Just, please give credit where credit is due. I DID work on this program and if you share it, at least keep all of the files intact (yes, including this one) so they at least know that I made it.

Also, about the monika.chr file, I took that from the game. It’s not necessary but I just wanted to put it in there. :3

Sorry, but 1.0 needs to have you download python. Later versions won’t have this but I couldn’t get it to convert. I’ll put a link to the python website for you. (https://www.python.org/)

I’ll post my links here if you want:
