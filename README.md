I used art assets from Doki Doki LIterature Club are created by team salvato
All Rights Reserved
This Latest Version of the Software is Version 1.0

Pls don’t sue ;_;

So I created this program basically because I’m a huge fan of what dan salvato has made with Doki Doki Literature Club and wanted to create something of my own. :3

With this program, I took the script from the ending of the game and made it it’s own standalone program. 
I will be adding features to the program as time goes on and I will be uploading them to my GitHub (https://github.com/JakeStarGames) as different versions. 
You can also actually contribute yourself by filling out this google survey for bug fixes, suggestions to the program, helping out with the program (?), etc. (https://goo.gl/forms/EyNbtlVUQmoEng2M2). 
I would greatly appreciate if you filled it out so I can get feedback and make the program even better! Then again, I’m happy that you even wanted to download and try my program out in the first place so thank you for that too! 
If you’re wondering what I used to make this program, I programmed it entirely in python. I included the source code on my GitHub also in case you wanna see the inner workings of the program (I like to do that too, don’t worry). 
Just, please give credit where credit is due. I DID work on this program and if you share it, at least keep all of the files intact (yes, including this one) so they at least know that I made it.

Also, about the monika.chr file, I took that from the game. It’s not necessary but I just wanted to put it in there. :3

Sorry, but 1.0 needs to have you download python. Later versions won’t have this but I couldn’t get it to convert. I’ll put a link to the python website for you. (https://www.python.org/)
Also, if the program gives a "error: tkinter is not found" or something like that. you have a older python (that's not python 3). This is a simple fix, just replace the "t" in "tkinter" with a uppercase "T". Do this for the 3 times the program has it (don't worry, they're around the beginning).

Version 1.1 includes a font from the original game called “Halogen”. You can install it and the program will automatically use it which makes it look more like the game. This font isn’t necessary to run the program because it’ll load up a generic font to use but the program will look more like the original game if you do install it! It also lets you use it in any program because it’s a universal font! :3

Version 1.1 Adds these features to the original program:
1.A GUI That looks more like the original game (basically it looks prettier and better)
2.The program actually remember’s your numbers at the beginning instead of entering it every time you open the program in the form of a file called save.txt (so that’s why it’s there)
3.The program has a little message when you press the close program button so be sure to press it :3

I decided to not make a compiled version because python doesn’t come with a compiler and it’s a huge pain to try to compile a program that wasn’t meant to compile

I’ll post my links here if you want:
